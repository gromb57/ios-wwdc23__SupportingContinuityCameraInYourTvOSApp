///
/// Apps can use this view for multiple components of a flash effect,
/// including the following:
/// - A quick transition to a full screen color, typically white, to simulate a
/// camera's flash, which then fades away.
/// - A slower transition that temporarily shows a still image, typically at the
/// moment the first transition started, before fading away.

    /// 1. Reveals the subview with an opacity transition.
    /// 2. Displays the subview normally for `visibleDuration` seconds.
    /// 3. Fades out the subview for `easeOutDuration` seconds.
    /// 4. Calls the `completion` method, which typically removes the
    /// `FlashAndFade` instance from its parent view.
