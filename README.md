# Supporting Continuity Camera in your tvOS app

[Source](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/supporting_continuity_camera_in_your_tvos_app)

Capture high-quality photos, video, and audio in your Apple TV app by connecting
an iPhone or iPad as a continuity device.


## Overview

Continuity Camera brings the power of the cameras and microphones from an iOS or
iPadOS device to Apple TV, including advanced features like Center Stage and Portrait mode.

This sample project provides an example implementation that accesses a camera and
microphone from a nearby iPhone or iPad in an Apple TV app.
It builds on a similar sample, 
[Supporting Continuity Camera in your macOS app][macOS sample],
and shares some of its functionality, including automatic camera selection
and observing the state of video effects.
The following sections focus on the aspects specific to tvOS.

- Note: This sample code project is associated with WWDC23 session 10256:
[Discover Continuity Camera on tvOS][wwdc23 session 10256].

## Configure the sample code project

To run this sample app, you need the following:

* An Apple TV 4k (2nd generation) or later with tvOS 17 or later.
* An iPhone or iPad with iOS 17 or iPadOS 17, respectively, or later.

You need to run this sample code project on physical devices, because
Simulator doesn't include the components to support cameras.

Continuity Camera works with all iPhone and iPad models that support 
video effects in Control Center.
You need to sign in with an Apple ID that uses two-factor authentication for the
Apple TV and the device with a camera.
You can use a separate Apple ID for each device or the same Apple ID for both.

The first time you run the app on an Apple TV, the system prompts you for permission to
access to the camera and microphone.
The app needs these permissions to function correctly.


## Present the continuity device picker

When the app launches, it immediately presents a continuity device picker by calling the
[`continuityDevicePicker(isPresented:onDidConnect:)`][SwiftUI Continuity Picker]
modifier in its SwiftUI implementation. 

[SwiftUI Continuity Picker]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/videoplayer/4179211-continuitydevicepicker

``` swift
.continuityDevicePicker(isPresented: $showContinuityDevicePicker,
                        onDidConnect: handleNewConnectionForDevice)
.task {
    // Shows the picker when app has no continuity device at launch.
    if !captureManager.activateDefaultContinuityCameraDevice() {
        showContinuityDevicePicker = true
    }
```

The picker only appears if the `isPresented` parameter
— which is a Boolean [`Binding`][Binding] — is `true`.
The picker calls the closure the app passes to the `onDidConnect` parameter 
when a person selects a device and the system successfully connects to it.  

[Binding]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding

``` swift
func handleNewConnectionForDevice(_ device: AVContinuityDevice?) {
    guard let device else {
        print("The Continuity Device Picker didn't connect a device.")
        return
    }

    guard let firstCamera = device.videoDevices.first else {
        print("The Continuity Device Picker doesn't have any cameras.")
        return
    }

    captureManager.setActiveVideoInput(firstCamera,
                                       isUserPreferredCamera: true)
}
```

The handling closure's [`AVContinuityDevice`][AVContinuityDevice] parameter
represents the device that a person selects on their Apple TV.
Each continuity device has a [`videoDevices`][AVContinuityDevice-videoDevices] property,
which is an array of [`AVCaptureDevice`][AVCaptureDevice] instances.

[AVContinuityDevice]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcontinuitydevice
[AVContinuityDevice-videoDevices]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcontinuitydevice/4168312-videodevices
[AVCaptureDevice]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice

The app's [`handleNewConnectionForDevice(_:)`][ContentView-handleNewConnectionForDevice]
method is a minimal implementation that selects the first video device in the array.
Apps typically compare all the video device elements and select one that's appropriate
for their needs.

[ContentView-handleNewConnectionForDevice]: x-source-tag://ContentView-handleNewConnectionForDevice

- Note: [`UIKit`][UIKit] based apps can create a continuity device picker by creating an
[`AVContinuityDevicePickerViewController`][AVContinuityDevicePickerViewController]
instance.

[AVContinuityDevicePickerViewController]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avcontinuitydevicepickerviewcontroller


## Connect a video device to a capture session

The app's [`CaptureManager`][CaptureManager] class creates and maintains an
[`AVCaptureSession`][AVCaptureSession] instance for the app's lifetime.
The capture manager's [`setActiveVideoInput(_:)`][setActiveVideoInput] method
creates an [`AVCaptureDeviceInput`][AVCaptureDeviceInput] instance from the video device,
and then tests to see whether it's an acceptable input for the capture session.

[CaptureManager]: x-source-tag://CaptureManager
[AVCaptureSession]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession
[setActiveVideoInput]: x-source-tag://CaptureManager.setActiveVideoInput
[AVCaptureDeviceInput]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput

``` swift
let name = camera.localizedName
print("Setting video input to: \(name).")

// Creates a video input with the camera.
guard let videoInput = try? AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: camera) else {
    print("Couldn't make an input from: \(name).")
    return false
}

// Checks whether the capture session accepts the new camera as an input.
guard session.canAddInput(videoInput) else {
    print("Capture session rejected '\(name)' as an input.")
    return false
}

// Adds the new camera input to the capture session.
activeInput = videoInput
```

If the new device is an acceptable input, the method assigns it to the app's 
[`activeInput`][activeInput] property.
The property updates the capture session with its `willSet` and `didSet`
property observers.

[activeInput]:x-source-tag://activeInput

``` swift
internal var activeInput: AVCaptureDeviceInput? {
    willSet {
        if let oldInput = activeInput {
            session.removeInput(oldInput)
        }
    }
    didSet {
        if let newInput = activeInput {
            session.addInput(newInput)
        }
        isActive = (activeInput != nil)
    }
}
```

The `willSet` observer removes the capture session's current input, if
applicable. The `didSet` observer adds the new input to the capture session.
The `didSet` observer also updates the [`isActive`][isActive] Boolean property,
which can cause the app to change its behavior and UI. 

[isActive]:x-source-tag://isActive

## Register for capture device updates

The app receives various updates related to its capture device by registering
with [NotificationCenter][NotificationCenter] and with key-value observation (KVO).
See [Using Key-Value Observing in Swift][Using Key-Value Observing in Swift]
and [NSKeyValueObserving][NSKeyValueObserving] for more information.

[NotificationCenter]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter
[Using Key-Value Observing in Swift]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/using-key-value-observing-in-swift
[NSKeyValueObserving]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/nskeyvalueobserving

The app specifically registers for the following events:

* A specific video effect, such as Center Stage, changes its active state. 
* The system changes the capture device it prefers.
* The active capture device disconnects from the system.

- Note: People can enable video effects in Control Center on Apple TV.

The sample's implementation that monitors the video effects and system changes
is similar to the macOS equivalent of this sample, [Supporting Continuity Camera in your macOS app][macOS sample].
The sample also monitors Notification Center events related to the camera.
The app's capture manager responds when a capture device disconnects
by registering with Notification Center for the
[`.AVCaptureDeviceWasDisconnected`][AVCaptureDeviceWasDisconnected]
event.

[AVCaptureDeviceWasDisconnected]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnotification/name/1389018-avcapturedevicewasconnected
[NSNotification.Name]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnotification/name

``` swift
func observeCamera(_ camera: AVCaptureDevice) {
    // Tells the observer to watch the new camera's properties.
    videoEffectsObvserver.observeCamera(camera)

    // Tells the notification observer to monitor camera-related events.
    notificationObserver.observeCamera(camera,
                                       with: notification(_:for:))
}
```

The app's [`CaptureDeviceNotificationObserver`][CaptureDeviceNotificationObserver]
structure listens for the these events on behalf of the capture manager and
calls the manager's [`notification(_:for:)`][captureManager.notification] method for
each event it gets from Notification Center.

## Configure the audio engine with an audio input device

At launch, the app creates an [`AudioCapturer`][AudioCapturer] instance,
which checks for audio inputs (microphones).
It does this by inspecting the
[`AVAudioSession.availableInputs`][AVAudioSession.availableInputs] property of the
[`AVAudioSession`][AVAudioSession] type's shared instance, and then monitoring
the property for updates.

[AudioCapturer]:x-source-tag://AudioCapturer
[AVAudioSession]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosession
[AVAudioSession.availableInputs]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosession/1616557-availableinputs

The app monitors for new microphones — similar to how the app's
capture manager monitors for new cameras — by observing the
[`isInputAvailable`][isInputAvailable] property of the 
`AVAudioSession` type's shared instance.

[isInputAvailable]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosession/1616524-isinputavailable 

``` swift
private static let inputAvailableKeyPath = "isInputAvailable"

func registerForInputAvailabilityUpdates(on session: AVAudioSession) {
    session.addObserver(self,
                        forKeyPath: Self.inputAvailableKeyPath,
                        options: [.new],
                        context: nil)
}
```

When the app has access to a microphone, it configures
an [`AVAudioEngine`][AVAudioEngine] instance in the audio capturer's 
[`setupAndStartAudioSession()`][setupAndStartAudioSession] method.

[AVAudioEngine]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudioengine
[setupAndStartAudioSession]: x-source-tag://setupAndStartAudioSession

``` swift
func setupAndStartAudioSession() {
    configureAudioOutput()
    enableVoiceProcessing(true)
    configureAudioSessionForVoiceChat()
    startAudioEngine()
}
```

The method configures the audio engine for a conference call scenario when the
app gains access to a microphone — at launch or later — with the following steps: 

1. Configures the audio engine to produce sound from the system's first audio output.
2. Enables voice processing on the audio engine's input node.  
3. Configures the audio engine for conversational audio.
4. Starts the audio engine.


## Configure the audio engine for a call

The third step is important for conferencing apps that use Voice over IP (VoIP).
The [`configureAudioSessionForVoiceChat`][configureAudioSessionForVoiceChat] method
configures the audio session by passing the
[`.voiceChat`][AVAudioSession.Mode.voiceChat] mode to the audio session's
[`setCategory(_:options:)`][setCategory(_:options:)] method.

[configureAudioSessionForVoiceChat]: x-source-tag://configureAudioSessionForVoiceChat
[AVAudioSession.Mode.voiceChat]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosession/mode/1616455-voicechat
[setCategory(_:options:)]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosession/1616442-setcategory

``` swift
try avAudioSession.setCategory(.playAndRecord,
                               mode: .voiceChat,
                               options: [])
```

The app gains access to additional audio features and microphone modes,
including automatic gain correction, voice processing, and muting,
by configuring the audio session for VoIP.

The app's audio interface has a button that lets a person temporarily disable
microphone processing, including echo cancellation, by bypassing the audio
engine's voice processing.
Each time a person toggles the button, the app calls audio capturer's 
[`bypassVoiceProcessing(_:)`][bypassVoiceProcessing] method.

[bypassVoiceProcessing]: x-source-tag://bypassVoiceProcessing

``` swift
public func bypassVoiceProcessing(_ bypass: Bool) {
    // If true, temporarily disables echo cancelation.
    avAudioEngine.inputNode.isVoiceProcessingBypassed = bypass

    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        self.isVoiceProcessingBypassed = bypass
    }

    var message = "Audio engine's voice processing: "
    message += bypass ? "bypassed" : "normal"
    print(message)
}
```

The app can temporarily disable voice processing by setting the
[`isVoiceProcessingBypassed`][isVoiceProcessingBypassed] property of the
audio engine's [`inputNode`][inputNode] to `true`.
This gives the app all the incoming audio from the microphone without any
adjustments from the system.

[isVoiceProcessingBypassed]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudioinputnode/3152103-isvoiceprocessingbypassed
[inputNode]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudioengine/1386063-inputnode

- Note: The behavior of the audio engine's `isVoiceProcessingBypassed` property is similar to
[`kAUVoiceIOProperty_BypassVoiceProcessing`][kAUVoiceIOProperty_BypassVoiceProcessing].
